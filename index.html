        <p>This page represents the Digital Standards working in the open to share the analysis of alignment with the Digital Standards</p>
        <p>The information displayed here does not represent any form of performance or metrics tracking on behalf of 
            Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) or the Government of Canada (GC).</p>
        <p>The anonymized information being shared is in the spirit of Open Data and Working in the Open, to share information
            regarding the alignment to the Digital Standards.
        </p>
        <p>This page is currently a prototype, and more information will be added as work progresses.</p>
        <hr />

        <p>This data is generated through analyzing submitted concept cases. Work is underway to improving our data collection 
            and reporting to remove subjectivity as much as possible. For the time being, this is the data at hand, and we
            are actively working to improve the quality and quantity of said data.
        </p>

        <p>A concept case was judged whether or not it aligned with a Digital Standard. This means if the concept case
             identified that that it had met a given Digital Standard, but was judged not to have adequately
            met the standard, then it will result as having not aligned in the data below.</p>

        <p>Work is presently underway to provide further guidance regarding what would be considered to align
            with a Digital Standard. In the spirit of working in the open, the work presently underway can be viewed
