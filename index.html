        <p>This page represents the Digital Standards working in the open to share the analysis of alignment with the Digital Standards</p>
        <p>The information displayed here does not represent any form of performance or metrics tracking on behalf of 
            Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) or the Government of Canada (GC).</p>
        <p>The anonymized information being shared is in the spirit of Open Data and Working in the Open, to share information
            regarding the alignment to the Digital Standards.
        </p>
        <p>This page is currently a prototype, and more information will be added as work progresses.</p>
        <hr />

        <p>This data is generated through analyzing submitted concept cases. Work is underway to improving our data collection 
            and reporting to remove subjectivity as much as possible. For the time being, this is the data at hand, and we
            are actively working to improve the quality and quantity of said data.
        </p>

        <p>A concept case was judged whether or not it aligned with a Digital Standard. This means if the concept case
             identified that that it had met a given Digital Standard, but was judged not to have adequately
            met the standard, then it will result as having not aligned in the data below.</p>

        <p>Work is presently underway to provide further guidance regarding what would be considered to align
            with a Digital Standard. In the spirit of working in the open, the work presently underway can be viewed

        <h3>Empower Staff to Deliver Better Services</h3>
        <p>In order to promote innovation and create agility within our organizations, the teams that make up our organizations must be empowered. 
            Aim to hire good people not to tell them what to do, but to have them tell you what to do. Ensuring professional advancement is available to retain high performers throughout their career.</p>

        <p>The government manages large, highly complex, crucially important services for their users. 
            A top-down command and control approach to service delivery and designs enforces a structure that aligns to the structure itself, rather than to the needs of the users or based on the expertise of those building the services. 
            Rather than bringing information to authority, bring authority to the information. Those best suited to solve a given problem are those closest to the problem.
            By removing decision-making authority from the teams into complex governance structures, the innovative potential of teams is mitigated by legacy governance procedures and processes.</p>

        <p>In order to create organizations that are able to create high quality services and iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. 
            Therefore the following outlines the alignment of the Digital Standards under the condition of 'Empowering Staff to Deliver Better Services.'</p>
